# 👋 Hello, I'm Manoj Arulmurugan!

### 🎓 About Me
I am a first-year **Master's student in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison**, passionate about extracting insights from data and building AI-powered solutions. My journey in data science is fueled by a strong foundation in statistics and machine learning.

- 🌚 I have experience working with structured, unstructured, and image data to analyze real-world problems.
- 📚 Currently enhancing my skills through coursework in **Machine Learning, Statistical Methods & Modeling, Optimization, and Relational DBMS**.
- 🛠 I build ML models with **TensorFlow and PyTorch** for **Computer Vision** applications. I also leverage **traditional machine learning techniques** to build **forecasting, classification, and regression models** for **business and finance problems**.
- 💻 Proficient in **Python, SQL**, and **PowerBI**, with hands-on experience in classification, regression, and forecasting.
- 🏆 Recognized for delivering data-driven solutions, including dashboards that drive measurable real-world impact.
- 🔄 Currently interested in and actively learning more about **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
- 🌐 Open to **AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning projects** that can have a **direct real-world impact**.
- ☁️ Actively exploring **model deployment and cloud technologies in AWS and GCP**.
- ⚽ In my free time, I **play and watch football (soccer)**, **run**, and **watch anime**.

### 🚀 Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:

- 📈 **[Data-Driven Sales Forecasting and Customer Profiling](https://github.com/manojarulmurugan/Sales-Forecasting-and-Customer-Segmentation-on-HP-Sales-Data)** - Analyzed a **220,000-record HP Sales dataset**, performing **customer segmentation** based on product category, geographic location, and Customer Lifetime Value analysis to solve a real-world business problem. Forecasted product demand and revenue utilizing **ARIMA and LSTM**, achieving a **mean absolute error percentage of less than 1%**, showcasing expertise in predictive analytics and advanced modeling techniques.

- 💪 **[Customer Churn Prediction](#)** (Ongoing) - Developing a predictive model to analyze customer retention patterns and improve business strategies using **machine learning and data-driven insights**.

- 🧠 **[Fall Detection System](https://github.com/manojarulmurugan/Fall-Detection)** - Built a **deep learning model (Convolutional LSTM, LRCN)** for real-time fall detection using video classification.

- 💳 **[Credit Risk Analysis](https://github.com/manojarulmurugan/Credit-Profit-Risk-Analysis)** - Developed an ensemble model for **predicting credit risk**, achieving **97.7% accuracy**.

- 🏥 **[Lumbar Spine Degenerative Condition Classification](https://github.com/manojarulmurugan/Lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification)** - Built a **3D Image Classification Model** using **Vision Transformers & YOLO** (Ranked **Top 8% in Kaggle Competition**). Currently working on further enhancements to improve model accuracy and generalization.

- 🚖 **[Taxi Cab Fare Prediction](#)** - Competed in an **IIT Madras-mediated Kaggle contest**, achieving a **top 100 leaderboard ranking**. Implemented **hyperparameter tuning** and trained an optimized **Stacking Regression model** with **KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms**, attaining an **accuracy of 94%** to predict taxi-cab fare prices.
